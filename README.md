This will be the source code for Hungry Wolves Game.
A game I created while taking a course for videogame design from CalArts University.

The first iteration of the game had a few requisites:
- It had to be a one paper game, meaning rules, board and everything had to be in a A4 paper.
- You could use a pen, and 2 dice to play it.

So since its conception it has been a very simple game.
Through the course my peers reviewed my game and gave me feedback.
Then i worked on improvements and then asked for feedback again.
Repeated the same process a couple times.

Since it has been pretty fun to work on it on paper, I decided to put my coding skills into use and recreate it as a videogame.
And take the chance to practice a languagge i dont use very ofen, and learn about unity.
